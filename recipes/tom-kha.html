        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>This tom kha soup (Thai coconut soup) is absolutely perfect. Rich and creamy yet tangy and salty, this Thai soup is filling but light and positively bursting with flavor. <em>The very best recipe I've ever made or tried.</em> Whole30, paleo, and vegan options offered.</p>
          <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
            <li>half of one onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>half of one red jalapeno pepper</li>
            <li>3 1/4 inch slices ginger</li>
            <li>1 lemongrass stalk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons red Thai curry paste</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>4 cups canned full-fat coconut cream</li>
            <li>8 oz mushroom caps</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons coconut sugar</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>2-3 green onions</li>
            <li>fresh cilantro</li>
          </ul>
          <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
            <li>In a medium pot, heat the coconut oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno or chile, galangal or ginger, lemongrass, and red curry paste and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until onions are softened. Add vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Strain out the aromatics (the garlic, onions, lemongrass, and ginger) and discard. Add in coconut cream or milk, tofu, and mushrooms. Simmer until tofu pieces are just cooked through, then add fish sauce, coconut aminos (or coconut sugar), and lime juice, plus more of each to taste.</li>
            <li>Cook 2 minutes, then ladle into serving bowls and top with sliced green onions and fresh cilantro.</li>
            </ol>
