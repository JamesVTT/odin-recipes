          <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>2/12 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup steel cut oats</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt <em>do not omit this!</em></li>
            <li>Toppings and mix-ins of choice</li>
          </ul>
          <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
            <li>Place 2 1/2 cups water and milk in a medium/large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>As soon as the liquid boils, stir in the oats and salt. Return the mixture to a steady boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low so that the oats are at a gentle simmer. Do <strong>NOT </strong>walk away from the pot at this point, as oats sometimes like to boil over. If your oats start to foam up and you are concerned, lift the pan right off the heat and let it settle down a bit before returning the pan to the heat to finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Let the oats gently simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping along the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. At this point, judge how chewy or creamy you would like your oatmeal. For softer, creamier oats, continue cooking for 5 to 10 additional minutes, stirring every few minutes until the oatmeal is as tender as you like. If the oatmeal becomes thicker than you would like, splash in a little extra water or milk to thin it out to your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Remove the oatmeal from the heat and let sit a few minutes to finish thickening. Enjoy hot with any of your favorite toppings.</li>
